Loading graphed.html
What happens & why?
A rectangle appears, containing a yellow and blue circle.

When misspelling 'graphed' in the html file, certain aspects are missing.
The css file provides the black rectangle frame.
The js file provides the two circles.
The 'graphedpanel' shows the whole picture.

Chrome browser dev tool (Cntl-Shft-I)
Shows the debugger.
The console tab shows an error.
The sources tab shows the source files.
When the bug is fixed, the console tab is empty.

When reintroducing the bug, another error appears.
It is not the same error as earlier. This time, it is a GET error.
The misspelled file does not exist. 

Creating breakpoints in the browser:
How to step inside the draw function?
Break at line 60.
Click on 'step into'.

Inspecting elements.
Right clicking on blue circle and selecting 'inspect'.
It shows the origin of the shape in the source code.
What are the elements in the DOM tree between the root and the circle?

Implementing the Node selecting.
Selecting a node draws 4 rectangles around it.
Unfortunately, it creates more grabbers as you select other nodes.
So we need a repaint method.
